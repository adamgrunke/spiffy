Project Code Name: Spiffy

User Story: Easily create a new playlist with a minimal effort 
while maximizing specificity of the generated playlist. 

The Spotify API provides tools to tune the attributes of a playlist that 
users do not have access to in their native app. 

Give the users access to these tuneable controls and seed the playlist
generator with the user's current playlists.


API: Spotify

Technologies: Typescript, React (using hooks), Node.js, Axios, MongoDB
